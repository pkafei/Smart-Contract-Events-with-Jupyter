# Listing ENS Contract Events with Jupyter Docs

![ENS](https://www.easydns.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ensheader-261x300.png)


## Background:

This Jupyter notebook contains the list of "Bid Reveal" events for ENS contract 0x6090A6e47849629b7245Dfa1Ca21D94cd15878Ef.

## More Background:

ENS stands for [Ethereum Name Service](https://ens.domains/). Ethereum Name Service turns smart contract addresses into human-readable names. Think of it as DNS for Ethereum. ENS is slightly different than DNS because a person cannot simply buy an ENS address. They have to register it first, and then bid for the name. When the bidding occurs, the bid price is revealed. This Jupyter notebook lists all of the revealing bidding events in the past day or two.
